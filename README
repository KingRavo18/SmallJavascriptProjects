This repository was made with the intent to house many small javascript projects 
of mine, but I started making a to-do list with a back-end and database.
Now that to-do list is made of more code than all the other projects combined.
So in actuallity it's a few small js projects
and a not-so-small to-do list. 
I'll probably come back and connect it to a cloud database eventually, so the to-do list works on other machines,
but not now.
I'm moving on to other projects and abandoning this one for now.
